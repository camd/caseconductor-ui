Environment-related remote objects.

The nomenclature here is a massive pile of confusion, because the platform
follows one set of terminology that was determined to be too confusing for the
UI to use, so the UI uses a different set of terms. The translation, more or
less, takes place in this file and ccui/manage/views.py. Templates should
exclusively use UI terms.

Here, for reference, is a translation table with examples:
